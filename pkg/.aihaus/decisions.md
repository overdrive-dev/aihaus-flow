# Architectural Decision Records

## ADR-001: Files are state — no inter-agent messaging primitive

Date: 2026-04-13
Status: Accepted

### Context
aihaus needs a way for agents to read prior specialists' output during multi-step workflows. Claude Code offers two primitives: (1) Agent tool subagents (isolated, one-shot, return string), (2) Teammates with SendMessage (persistent, addressable).

### Decision
Use the Agent tool plus file-based handoff.

- **Per-agent artifact files** are the baseline: every agent writes to its own per-invocation artifact (REVIEW.md, CHALLENGES.md, VERIFICATION.md, etc.). Standard pattern for fan-out + synthesis, covers most multi-agent workflows.
- **CONVERSATION.md turn log** is an *optional* shared-log shape, used only when later rounds must read prior rounds as ordered turns. When used, the parent skill is the sole writer; agents have no Write access.

Not every multi-agent workflow needs a CONVERSATION.md. Simple fan-out + synthesis (e.g., `aih-run/SKILL.md:169-173` final-gate) uses only per-agent artifacts.

### Options Considered
1. (Chosen) Agent tool + per-agent artifact files + skill-mediated optional turn log.
2. Teammates + SendMessage — rejected: breaks audit trail, persistent sessions are heavier, inconsistent with file-based convention.
3. Agents share write access to a single shared log — rejected: write races, ordering corruption.
4. Single long-context agent plays all roles — rejected: loses specialization, adversarial stance, audit trail.

### Consequences
+ Full audit trail (every artifact and turn is persistent).
+ Resumable (crashed runs re-enter via files).
+ Stateless agents — cheap, re-runnable.
+ Per-agent artifacts alone are sufficient for the common case.
- No mid-flight agent-to-agent messaging. Parallel siblings cannot see each other's work until the skill consolidates.
- Ordering is skill-mediated, not agent-driven.
- Hardening gap: tool-level denial (no Write on CONVERSATION.md) only covers agents defined in this plan. Future skills that spawn agents with Write access rely on prose convention until a file-guard hook lands (tracked below).
- Future: if a real-time collaboration primitive becomes necessary, this ADR must be explicitly superseded.

### Follow-up work
- `pkg/.aihaus/hooks/file-guard.sh` extension to reject writes to `CONVERSATION.md` that shrink the file or alter bytes before the last `## Turn` marker. Estimated <20 lines of shell. Files as a standalone patch plan after this plan ships.
