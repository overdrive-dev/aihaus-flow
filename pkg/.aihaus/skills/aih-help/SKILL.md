# AIhaus Workflow Commands

AIhaus is a four-pillar intent-based workflow package. **Scope** the work, optionally **promote** a plan into a milestone draft, **execute** autonomously, and **resume** if interrupted.

## ⚠️ Upgrading from v0.1.x? Read this first

**`/aih-run` is NOT a rename of `/aih-milestone`.** They are distinct commands with different jobs:

| Command | Job | Produces |
|---------|-----|----------|
| `/aih-milestone` | **Scope** — conversational gathering mode. You send context across multiple messages; each one is absorbed into a draft. Never executes. | Draft at `.aihaus/milestones/drafts/[slug]/` |
| `/aih-run` | **Execute** — runs whatever ready draft or plan you point at. Full autonomous pipeline (planning agents → team → stories → completion). | Milestone at `.aihaus/milestones/[M0XX]-[slug]/` |

The old `/aih-milestone "description"` one-shot flow was **split in two**. If you want the old behavior, pass `--execute`: `/aih-milestone "desc" --execute`.

`team-template.md` and `completion-protocol.md` moved from `aih-milestone/` to `aih-run/` because that's where the execution logic now lives. `/aih-milestone` only deals with drafts.

## Four-Pillar Command Surface

| Pillar | Commands | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Scope** | `/aih-plan`, `/aih-milestone` | Create plans / gather milestone context conversationally |
| **Promote** | `/aih-plan-to-milestone` | Hand off a plan into a milestone draft for refinement |
| **Execute** | `/aih-run`, `/aih-feature`, `/aih-bugfix`, `/aih-quick` | Start autonomous work |
| **Continue** | `/aih-resume` | Pick up an interrupted run |

## All Commands

| Command | What It Does | Use When |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `/aih-init` | Bootstrap AIhaus in a project — creates `.aihaus/` layout and seeds project memory | First time using AIhaus in a repo |
| `/aih-plan [description]` | Research and write a plan without changing code | You want to think before building |
| `/aih-plan-to-milestone [slug]` | Promote a plan to a milestone draft for conversational refinement | Plan is big enough to warrant milestone treatment |
| `/aih-milestone [description]` | Enter gathering mode — iteratively build a milestone draft via conversation | You want to scope a milestone across multiple messages |
| `/aih-run [slug]` | Execute a ready milestone draft or plan — no slug required, picks from available | You have a draft/plan ready to execute |
| `/aih-resume [slug]` | Resume an interrupted run — detects in-progress work via RUN-MANIFEST.md | Session crashed, context reset, or you paused execution |
| `/aih-bugfix [description or error]` | Triage root cause, branch, fix, test, commit | Known bug or error message |
| `/aih-feature [description]` | Scoped feature: plan, branch, implement, test, commit — single agent | Change touching up to ~10 files |
| `/aih-quick [description]` | Fast-track a known change without planning overhead | Trivial change you already know how to do |
| `/aih-help` | This help page | You forgot what's available |
| `/aih-sync-notion [action]` | Sync the Notion Kanban board with current execution state | You mirror work to Notion |
| `/aih-update [--check\|--force]` | Update AIhaus to the latest version from the remote repo | New version available or agents need updating |

## Typical Flows

### Conversational milestone (recommended for large work)

```
/aih-milestone Multi-tenant workspaces
  -> draft created, gathering mode active
(user sends more context messages)
  -> each message absorbed into CONTEXT.md
(user: "start" or /aih-run [slug])
  -> autonomous execution from draft
```

### Plan first, then promote to milestone

```
/aih-plan Add billing subsystem with Stripe
  -> PLAN.md created
/aih-plan-to-milestone 260412-billing
  -> milestone draft seeded from plan
(iterate context conversationally)
/aih-run 260412-billing
  -> full milestone execution
```

### Quick feature from a plan

```
/aih-plan Add rate limiting to the public API
/aih-run 260410-rate-limiting
  -> small plan → feature-style single-branch execution
```

### Resume after interruption

```
(session crashes during milestone execution)
(new session starts)
/aih-resume
  -> detects interrupted milestone, resumes from checkpoint
```

### Quick fixes

```
/aih-bugfix "TypeError: cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
/aih-quick Add missing import for the Status enum
```

## Backward Compat

- `/aih-milestone "desc" --execute` — one-shot behavior (pre-gathering-mode) preserved as escape hatch.
- `/aih-milestone --plan [slug]` — auto-routes to `/aih-plan-to-milestone [slug]`, then enters gathering.
- `/aih-feature --plan [slug]` — still works for feature-from-plan shortcuts.

## Project Memory

All commands read `.aihaus/project.md` at the start so every agent shares the same project context — stack, conventions, verification commands — without you repeating them.

## Artifacts

All artifacts live under `.aihaus/`:
- `.aihaus/project.md` — Project-level context
- `.aihaus/plans/[slug]/` — Plans from `/aih-plan`
- `.aihaus/milestones/drafts/[slug]/` — In-progress milestone drafts (CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, CONVERSATION.md)
- `.aihaus/milestones/drafts/.archive/` — Drafts that have been promoted to milestones
- `.aihaus/milestones/[M0XX]-[slug]/` — Full milestone artifacts + RUN-MANIFEST.md checkpoint
- `.aihaus/features/[YYMMDD]-[slug]/` — Feature summaries + RUN-MANIFEST.md
- `.aihaus/bugfixes/[YYMMDD]-[slug]/` — Bugfix summaries + RUN-MANIFEST.md
- `.aihaus/memory/` — Persistent agent memory
- `.aihaus/decisions.md` / `.aihaus/knowledge.md` — Optional project-wide logs
